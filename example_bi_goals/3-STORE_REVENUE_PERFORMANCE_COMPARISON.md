# 3-STORE_REVENUE_PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON

## Overview
Compare sales performance across multiple stores to identify which stores are outperforming or underperforming. 
This analysis can inform decisions about optimizing store locations, adjusting store management, or reallocating resources to improve overall profitability and operational efficiency.

## Required Data Columns
- StoreID: Identifier for the store.
- SaleAmount: Total revenue from each sale.

## Data Preparation Steps
- Ensure that each transaction is correctly linked to the appropriate store using the StoreID from the Sales table.

## Calculation Instructions
1. Group transactions by StoreID.
2. Sum SaleAmount for each store to calculate total revenue.
3. Optionally, calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each store to identify its share of overall performance.

## Expected Outcome
A ranked list of stores based on total revenue performance, allowing comparison between stores to identify those that are outperforming or underperforming.

## Data-Driven Decision (DDDM)
KPI: Store Revenue Performance.
- Action: Identify high-performing stores to replicate successful strategies across other locations. For underperforming stores, consider strategic changes such as reallocation of resources, targeted marketing efforts, or potentially closing or restructuring low-performing stores.

## Additional Notes
- We don't usually refer to stores just by their ID â€” instead, we typically use a store name or location for better clarity in reports and analyses.
- RECOMMENDED: Create a Store Dimension Table if not already present to store additional store-specific attributes, such as:
  - StoreName: Name of the store.
  - City: The city in which the store is located.
  - State: The state in which the store is located.
  - Size: Physical size of the store (e.g., square footage).
  - LocationType: Type of store location (e.g., urban, suburban, or rural).

## Referential Integrity Reminder
- Always ensure that referential integrity is maintained by confirming that each StoreID in the Sales table corresponds to a valid StoreID in the Store Dimension Table.
